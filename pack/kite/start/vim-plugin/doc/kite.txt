Kite for VIM
============

VIM is now integrated with Kite! To get a taste of what Kite can do, open a
saved Python file and start coding away.

1. Autocompletions

As you code, Kite will provide autocompletion suggestions ranked by popularity
using all the open source code on GitHub.

2. Documentation

Press |K| when your cursor is over a identifier to open a split window with
documentation about the identifier. In addition to documentation, Kite also
provides information about where you've used the identifier in your codebase,
as well as curated code examples showing you how to use the identifier.

3. Goto Definition

Press |C-]| to jump to a method's defintion.

4. Copilot integration

While you code in VIM, the Copilot will automatically show you information
about the code that you're currently working with. To open the Copilot, click
on the Kite menubar icon and select "Open Copilot".
